# dataset preparation

## real-world data
First download real data from the [site](https://sites.google.com/view/EventZoom), then run `convert_eventzoom.py`.

## synthetic data
First download NfS data from the [site](http://ci2cv.net/nfs/index.html), then run `test_size.py` to filter some sequences whose size is invalid. Finally run `syn_nfs_rgb.py`.
